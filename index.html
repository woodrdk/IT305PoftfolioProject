        As a developer I use my technical talent to help people bring their creative and technical ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>
    My computer history started with taking some continuing education computer programming classes back in 1997 with my
        grandfather. I then started using my technical learning at my job doing their website and making websites for
        some other small businesses. After high school I shifted career directions following my love of automotive and
        became an automotive mechanic eventually becoming a bus mechanic up until 2014. After having a motorcycle
        accident leaving me unable to do mechanic work I began to think about new careers. Receiving a laptop for
        christmas in 2016 and seeing and ad for a class about making Android apps popped up drawing my interest.
        So after that freebie class I started looking into a formal education in the field of computer programming.
        Seven months later July 5th, 2017 to be exact I started classes at Clover Park Technical College. I took
        classes in the study of Computer Programming program, completing both the AAS-T and AAS degrees offerred by
        CPTC at the same time, in 7 Qtrs. I finished this program March 21, 2019 and am enrolled with plans to start
        at Green River College in September 2019 for their BAS in Software Development.

    My paralysis has created a more technical drive of projects for both a personal level and for the disabled
        community. This has helped me come up with several ideas including a current project I am working on
        www.whowherehow.org (still in beta), along with other things like learning more of the programming arduino,
        and raspberry pi computers to make devices to assist the disabled. A couple personal projects I have in the
        works would be wheelchair assisted drive, remote control grocery hauler, and home automation on a diy level,+
        to name a few projects.
